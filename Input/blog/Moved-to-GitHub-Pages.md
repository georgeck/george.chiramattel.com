Finally moved my site to GitHub Pages. An essential prerequisite for this move is that I needed a good static site generator. There are lots of good [static generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) out there. I wanted something that is based on .Net â€“ and if it can be ported to .Net core and supports Razor that would be a bonus. I ended up choosing [wyam](http://wyam.io/). Porting my existing content proved to be an easy task. This has been something that I wanted to get done for a long time. I am glad that it is finally done - just in time for new year.
