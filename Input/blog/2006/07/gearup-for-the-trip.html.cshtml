<p>List of the gears that we are taking for the trip:</p>

<ul>
<li>We got ourself each a good back-pack. Not the most expensive one, but a good one. One is quite tall and has a capacity of about 60 Liters! The <span>other</span> one is smaller (around 40 Liters) and this will be the one that we will be <span>carrying</span> around mostly. We are planning to finish all our packing in these two.</li>
<li>Secondly, we got ourself some very light summer clothing. Europe is going through a heat-wave. So I guess this will help.</li>
<li>For photography, I borrowed (from <span>Venkat</span>) some CF storage for my <a href="https://george.chiramattel.com/blog/2005/05/29/my_new_digital_slr.html"><span>EOS</span> 350D</a>. Now I have a total of 1.75 GB storage! So I can shoot away (in RAW mode) to glory.Â  Also I am packing standard <span>accessories</span> like external flash, tripod, chargers etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>I am also <span>carrying</span> my laptop (a <a href="https://www.pc.ibm.com/us/thinkpad/xseries/tablet/">IBM <span>Thinkpad</span> X41 tablet</a>). I am hoping that I can continue to <span>blog</span> about the trip. Also the laptop will help free up the space on the CF cards when they are full.</li>
</ul>
Total weight so far for both of us combined is about 20 Kg, which is not bad (considering all the gadgets that I am <span>carrying</span>)!<br/>
