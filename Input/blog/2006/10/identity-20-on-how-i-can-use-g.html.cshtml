<p>This is a continuation of my <a href="http://www.chiramattel.com/george/blog/2006/10/23/identity_20.html">previous</a> post on OpenID.</p> <p>Today I will explain, how you can personalize your OpenID URL when using the VeriSign <a href="https://pip.verisignlabs.com/">Personal Identity provider (PIP)</a>&nbsp;system. </p> <p>Step 1: You should create a&nbsp;OpenID account&nbsp;with your Identity provider. In my case, my OpenID is <a href="http://georgeck.pip.verisignlabs.com">http://georgeck.pip.verisignlabs.com</a>. Now, that doesn't sound like a name I would want to remember or associate as my OpenID. Another reason why I wouldn't want to use the default ID created by my service provider is that, I don't want to be tied down to a specific vendor. What if my identity provider shuts down!</p> <p>Step 2: Create a unique URL&nbsp;which you can control and setup a redirect to the Identity Provider. Again, taking my example - <a href="http://george.chiramattel.com">http://george.chiramattel.com</a> is my site and I have full control over it. I edit the default page there and add the following meta info into the HTML header. (Remember the following example is for me and VeriSign PIP).</p> <blockquote> <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;link href="http://georgeck.pip.verisignlabs.com/server" rel="openid.server" /&gt;<br>&lt;link href="http://georgeck.pip.verisignlabs.com/" rel="openid.delegate" /&gt; <br>&lt;head/&gt;</p></blockquote> <p>.. followed by the rest of the HTML document ..</p> <p>This&nbsp;instructs the requesting site to redirect to&nbsp;my actual Identity provider. At a later point in time, if I wish to change my Identity provider, All I need to do is modify the above snippet and point it to my new provider.</p>
