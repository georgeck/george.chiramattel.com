<p>First,&nbsp;let me define Identity 2.0. Wikipedia defines Identity 2.0 as....</p> <blockquote><b>Identity 2.0</b>, also called digital identity, is the anticipated revolution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity">identity</a> verification on the Internet using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> standard. Identity 2.0 stems from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> theory of the world wide web transition. It's emphasis is a simple and open method of identity transactions similar to those in the physical world, such as driver's license. </blockquote> <p>OpenID is not the only player in this field. Other solutions include:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/reference/infocard/default.aspx">InfoCard</a>&nbsp;from Microsoft  <li><a href="https://www.projectliberty.org/">Liberty Alliance</a>  <li><a href="https://www.inames.net/">i-names</a>&nbsp; and the list is growing...</li></ul> <p>I also found a solution from <a href="https://whobar.org/">whobar</a> that </p> <blockquote> <p>allows users to login to a website using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/reference/infocard/default.aspx">InfoCard</a>, <a href="https://www.openid.net">OpenID</a> or <a href="https://www.inames.net/">i-names</a> and makes it all transparent to the web application</p></blockquote> <p>in which case&nbsp;the login screen would look something like this.</p> <p><a title="WhoBar" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/276662742/"><img alt="WhoBar" hspace="0" src="https://static.flickr.com/122/276662742_f3c9849f74.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p><strong>So, what does all this mean to the end user?</strong></p> <p>To understand this better, let me take you through the experience of authenticating myself to an OpenID enabled site. In this example I have used the free OpenID service provided by VeriSign called <a href="https://pip.verisignlabs.com/">Personal Identity provider (PIP)</a>.</p> <p>Step 1: I want to login to an OpenID enabled site. I am using <a href="https://www.opinity.com/">Opinity</a> as an example. To login, I am presented with a text box to enter my unique identity URL. Notice the OpenID logo in the text box. </p> <p><a title="Step-1" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/276699390/"><img alt="Step-1" hspace="0" src="https://static.flickr.com/114/276699390_39a5eb0f1d.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>Step 2: Once I enter my unique ID, (in this case <a href="https://george.chiramattel.com">george.chiramattel.com</a>), I am redirected to my Identity provider, which is VeriSign. I login to VeriSign and I am presented with the following screen from VeriSign. Here I can&nbsp;authorize VeriSign to 'prove' my identity to the referring site - Opinity. As you can see, I can set a timelimit to my authorization. I can also choose to share some personal profile information that I have previously stored with VeriSign with Opinity - but in this case Opinity is not expecting any such information.</p> <p><a title="Step-2" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/276698139/"><img alt="Step-2" hspace="0" src="https://static.flickr.com/91/276698139_d7ef7af632.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>Notice that VeriSign mentions my name as <a href="https://georgeck.pip.verisignlabs.com">https://georgeck.pip.verisignlabs.com</a>. I will explain how I could configure this in a later blog. Once I confirm my authorization, I am redirected back to the referring site (Opinity) and (ideally) I should be logged in.</p> <p><strong>How is this different from a normal web-signin?</strong></p> <p>To start with, I don't have to maintain different passwords for different sites. My identity is my unique URL and I can present it to any site to let them know who I am.&nbsp;Now to prove it is really me who is presenting this URL, I use the service of the OpenID server, who ascertains my claim&nbsp;on my behalf.</p> <p>I will explain details on how I configured my OpenID&nbsp;in a later blog.</p>
