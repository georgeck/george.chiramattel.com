<p>As you can see, I have incorporated <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense">Google Adsense</a> into my site. According to Google..</p> <blockquote>Certain locations tend to be more successful than others. This "heat map" illustrates these ideal placements on a sample page layout. The colors fade from dark orange (strongest performance) to light yellow (weakest performance).<br><a title="Adsense HeatMap" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/241662966/"><img alt="Adsense HeatMap" hspace="0" src="http://static.flickr.com/96/241662966_cc4c439778.jpg" border="0"></a></blockquote>Based on this advise, I have inserted AdSense for the first two blog entries in the list. The following&nbsp;<a href="http://weblog.ashaland.com/ashaland/2006/06/how_to_place_go.html">blog entry</a>&nbsp;describes the process of placing AdSense ads&nbsp;between blog posts.
