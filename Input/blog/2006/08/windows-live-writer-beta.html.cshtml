 <p>I am writing this post using Windows Live Writer (Beta). Currently the beta is available for download <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/9/a/f9a19f2d-cec4-4a25-9b0b-eb9655ea7561/Writer.msi">here</a>. </p> <p>I am pleasantly surprised with its capabilities. To start with, it can connect to blog services other than&nbsp;<a href="https://spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Spaces</a>. And once it is configured, it downloads even the visual theme from the blog site. So while you are editing the blog, the visual theme is presented.</p> <p><a title="Windows-Live-Writer" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/224614172/"><img alt="Windows-Live-Writer" hspace="0" src="https://static.flickr.com/92/224614172_7a11c7dbbd.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>the tool&nbsp;also exposes a plugin API (currently available <a href="https://g.msn.com/8SEENUS030000TBR/WriterSDK">here</a>). </p> <p>Quite a few plugins are already available. One of which (<a href="https://www.flickr4writer.com">flickr4Writer</a>) allows you to insert images from Flicker (and this is the plugin I used to insert the above picture). </p>
