<p>I have been working (along with my sister and cousin) on an <a href="https://www.xmpp.org">XMPP</a> based IM client. This is fully implemented in DotNet. The current version (1.0.1) can connect to Google Talk. The project is hosted&nbsp;<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chatapp/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>You can get the latest code from the following SVN url:<br><a href="https://chatapp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">https://chatapp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/</a></p> <p>Here are some screen shots of the application.</p> <p><a title="Main Window" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/494963138/"><img alt="Main Window" src="https://static.flickr.com/217/494963138_31864bb646.jpg" border="0"></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>And the Chat Window</p> <p><a title="ChatWindow" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/494963140/"><img alt="ChatWindow" src="https://static.flickr.com/217/494963140_8042dd00de.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>The 'About Box' describes the different components that we are using.</p> <p><a title="AboutBox" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/10077187@N00/494963148/"><img alt="AboutBox" src="https://static.flickr.com/197/494963148_7d76abf5c4.jpg" border="0"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;I would appreciate your valuable comments - please post them <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chatapp/issues/list">here</a>.</p>
