    Dejavu
</h3>
<p>
    Another fun project that I worked on is Dejavu. Dejavu is a Windows 7 Shell Extension
    that allows the user to version Windows 7 Libraries in a way that is very similar
    to TimeMachine in Mac. Dejavu uses Git versioned files system. Once a file is 
    added to Dejavu, the user can use the Git engine to sync the files remotely to 
    any other location or machine.</p>
